## About This Project

This project is an **old experimental Roblox cheat template** that is no longer actively maintained. It has been uploaded for:

* Learning purposes
* Code reference
* Architecture examples
* UI framework testing
* Memory interaction experiments

The template provides a basic framework that developers can study and modify to understand how game tools and debugging utilities are built.

---

## Project Goals

This repository exists to help developers:

* Understand low-level programming concepts
* Practice reverse engineering techniques
* Learn modular cheat menu architecture
* Improve C++ memory interaction skills
* Experiment with overlay UI systems

This is **not a ready-to-use cheat** and is not guaranteed to function with current Roblox versions.

## Features (Template Level)

Depending on the version uploaded, the template may include:

* Basic menu framework
* Memory reading/writing structure
* Hooking placeholders
* Input handling
* Modular feature system
* Configuration saving system

Some features may be incomplete or outdated.

## Educational Use Cases

This project can be used for:

* Studying game hacking fundamentals
* Building anti-cheat detection tools
* Understanding how exploits work internally
* Creating debugging utilities
* Practicing secure coding

If you are interested in **defensive security**, this project can also help you understand how cheats operate so you can design better protection systems.
